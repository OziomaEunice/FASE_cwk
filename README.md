# Housing Of The Future
The “Housing of the Future” project tackles the challenge of balancing household comfort with minimal fuel consumption through a house control system. 
I developed a smart home control system to optimize energy efficiency and ensure occupant safety using Ada-SPARK. 
Key features include:
  - temperature regulation, window management, kitchen appliance control, and carbon monoxide monitoring.
